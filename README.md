# shader-fractals

Playing around with OpenGL, GLSL, GLFW, GLEW by making Interactive Fractal Visualizations for Mandelbrot, Julia and more.

## Dependencies

This program requires the following dependencies to compile and run:

- GLEW: The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library, for managing OpenGL extensions.
- GLFW: A library for creating windows, contexts, and handling inputs for OpenGL.
- OpenGL: For rendering graphics.
- Standard build tools: gcc, make.

## Building

To build the program, run the following command:

```bash
./compile.sh
```

This will create two executable named `mandelbrot` and `julia` in the current directory.

## Running

To run the program, execute the following command:

```bash
./mandelbrot

# or

./julia
```
